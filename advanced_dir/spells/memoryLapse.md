 **Memory Lapse**

**School** enchantment [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer_dir/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft._dir/2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a [Diplomacy](../../../skills_dir/diplomacy#_diplomacy), [Intimidate](../../../skills_dir/intimidate#_intimidate), or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.
