With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents. Until the end of the spell's duration, you treat those affected by it as if they were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on [Bluff](../../skill_dir/bluff#_bluff), [Knowledge](../../skill_dir/knowledge#_knowledge), [Perception](../../skill_dir/perception#_perception), [Sense Motive](../../skill_dir/senseMotive#_sense-motive), and [Survival](../../skill_dir/survival#_survival) checks against them. If an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies, it is shaken instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
