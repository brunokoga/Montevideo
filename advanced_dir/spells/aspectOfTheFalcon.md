**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minut_dir/level

You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on [Perception](../../skill_dir/perception#_perception) checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19–20/×3. This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the [Improved Critical](../../feats#_improved-critical) feat or a _ [keen](../../magicItem_dir/weapons#_weapons-keen)_ weapon.
