 **Moonstruck**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** druid 4, sorcerer_dir/wizard 4, witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered moonstone )

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft._dir/level)

**Target** one humanoid creature

**Duration** 1 round_dir/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen. The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage appropriate for the creature's size, and for the remainder of the spell's duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous _ [rage](../../../spells_dir/rage#_rage)_ and _ [confusion](../../../spells_dir/confusion#_confusion)_ spells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference to other actions. During the final round of the spell's duration, the target is again dazed as it returns to its normal state.
