Aura of Doom

**School** necromancy [emotion, fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M_dir/DF (powdered bone)

**Range** personal

**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** 10 minute_dir/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You emanate an almost palpable aura of horror. All non-allies within this spell's area, or that later enter the area, must make a Will save to avoid becoming shaken. A successful save suppresses the effect. Creatures that leave the area and come back must save again to avoid being affected by the effect.
