Wooden Phalanx

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 9, sorcerer_dir/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Effect** three or more wood golems, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart (see text)

You create 1d4+2 [wood golems](../../monsters_dir/golem#_golem-wood) with the [advanced template](../../monsters_dir/monsterAdvancement#_advanced-creature). The golems willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. You can only have one _wooden phalanx_ spell in effect at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.
