**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as _ [pain strike](../../advanced_dir/spells_dir/painStrike#_pain-strike)_\*\* and _ [symbol of pain](../../spells_dir/symbolOfPain#_symbol-of-pain)_) do not affect the target until this spell's duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts.
