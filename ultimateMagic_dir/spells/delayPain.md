**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as _ [pain strike](advanced/spell_dir/painStrike#_pain-strike)_\*\* and _ [symbol of pain](spells/symbolOfPain#_symbol-of-pain)_) do not affect the target until this spell's duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts.
