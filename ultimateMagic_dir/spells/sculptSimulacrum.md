Sculpt Simulacrum

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** simulacrum touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create cosmetic changes to a simulacrum, similar to _ [disguise self](spell_dir/disguiseSelf#_disguise-self_, except the changes are physical rather than illusory. This does not change any of the simulacrum's abilities.
