This functions like _ [keen edge](spells_dir/keenEdge#_keen-edge)_, except it affects multiple weapons and requires your concentration. You select the weapons to be affected, and can only affect one weapon per creature. If a creature's weapon exceeds the spell's range, the spell ends for that weapon.
