Malfunction

**School** transformation; Level sorcere_dir/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** one construct

**Duration** 1 roun_dir/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

This functions as _ [confusion](spells/confusion#_confusion)_, except it only affects constructs, and instead of babbling incoherently, the construct takes no actions on its turn (but may still make attacks of opportunity).
