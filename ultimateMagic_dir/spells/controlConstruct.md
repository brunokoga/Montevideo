Control Construct

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer_dir/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft._dir/2 levels)

**Target** one construct

**Duration** concentration

**Saving Throw** none (see text); **Spell Resistance** no

You wrest the control of a construct from its master. For as long as you concentrate, you can control the construct as if you were its master. You must make a [Spellcraft](../../skills_dir/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check each round to maintain control. The DC of the [Spellcraft](../../skills_dir/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check is (10 + the construct's HD). If the construct's creator or master is present and trying to control the construct, you both must make opposed Spellcraft checks each round to control the construct.
