Twisted Space

**School** transmutation; **Level** magus 2, sorcerer_dir/wizard 2, summoner 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a length of wire bent into a circle)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft._dir/2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You distort the space around a creature, twisting the path of its melee attacks unpredictably, but always toward a nearby creature that the target threatens. Until the start of your next turn, melee attacks made by the target creature affect a random target instead of their intended target.
