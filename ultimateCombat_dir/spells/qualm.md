Qualm

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 2, inquisitor 2, sorcerer_dir/wizard 2, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft._dir/2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute_dir/level or until discharged

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

The target is suddenly beset with unexplainable doubts about the effectiveness of its actions and the righteousness of its cause. The creature takes a â€“10 penalty on its ability checks, skill checks, and concentration checks, until the duration ends, or until it spends its entire turn doing absolutely nothing (it spends a full-round action gaining focus). Spending an entire turn doing nothing discharges the spell.
