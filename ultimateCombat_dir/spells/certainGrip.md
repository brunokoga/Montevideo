Certain Grip

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M_dir/DF (a tiny ball of tar)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

The subject's grip and footing become sure, granting a +4 competence bonus on [Climb](../skills_dir/climb#_climb) checks, on [Acrobatics](../skills_dir/acrobatics#_acrobatics) checks to balance, and to CMD against bull rush, drag, reposition, and trip attempts. While affected by this spell, the target is also immune to the disarm combat maneuver.
