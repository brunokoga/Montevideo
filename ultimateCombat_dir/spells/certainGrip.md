Certain Grip

**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 2, druid 2, sorcere_dir/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a tiny ball of tar)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 minute_dir/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

The subject's grip and footing become sure, granting a +4 competence bonus on [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) checks, on [Acrobatics](skill_dir/acrobatics#_acrobatics) checks to balance, and to CMD against bull rush, drag, reposition, and trip attempts. While affected by this spell, the target is also immune to the disarm combat maneuver.
