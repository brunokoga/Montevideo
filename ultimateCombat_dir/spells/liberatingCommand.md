Liberating Command

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, cleric 1, druid 1, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer_dir/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft._dir/2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an [Escape Artist](skills_dir/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum +20). This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using the [Escape Artist](skills_dir/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) skill (for example, if he were under the effects of a _ [hold person](spells_dir/holdPerson#_hold-person)_ spell or paralyzed by Strength damage).
