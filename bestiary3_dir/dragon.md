# Dragon, Imperial

Although chromatic and metallic dragons are the most widely known, other categories of true dragon exist. Presented here are the five imperial dragons, regal guardians of ancient lands and servants of cosmic balance.

## Age Categories

Many of a true dragon's abilities, attacks, and other statistics improve as the dragon grows older. These increases are divided into 12 age categories—as a dragon ages, its base statistics change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table.

**Age Category** : This is the age category's name.

**Age in Years** : This is the dragon's actual age.

**CR** : This column modifies the dragon's base CR.

**Size** : This column shows the number of size categories to increase the dragon's base size by, depending on its age (from Tiny to Small, Small to Medium, and so on). A true dragon does not gain the standard increases to ability scores when it achieves a larger size—instead, true dragons gain ability score increases according to their age category, as indicated on the Dragon Ability Scores table.

**Hit Dice** : This shows how many additional Hit Dice a dragon gains over its base Hit Dice as it grows. Increases to Hit Dice grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks as well as increasing the dragon's base attack bonus and base save bonuses. A dragon has skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die. A dragon's increases to ability scores for gaining Hit Dice are included in the total ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table).

**Natural Armor** : This shows the amount the dragon's base natural armor bonus increases by with each age category.

**Breath Weapon** : Each dragon has a breath weapon (see Combat) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon's breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a base breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of acid damage would deal 14d6 points of acid damage (due to the ×7 multiplier).

## Combat

The Dragon Attacks and Speeds table lists the attacks a dragon can employ and the damage it deals (a dash indicates a dragon of that size does not possess that natural attack). Dragons gain other abilities described here when they reach a specific age category.

**[Fly](skill_dir/fly#_fly Speed** : A dragon's fly speed increases as indicated, according to its size. Imperial dragons are wingless and their flight is a supernatural ability.

**Bite** : This is a primary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (even though it has more than one attack). A dragon's bite attack has reach as if the creature were one size category larger (+10 feet for Colossal dragons).

**Claws** : These primary attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon's Strength bonus.

**Gore** : As they are wingless, Medium and larger imperial dragons make gore attacks with their horns instead of wing attacks. A gore is a primary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. An imperial dragon's gore attack has reach as if the creature were one size category larger (+10 feet for Colossal dragons).

**Tail Slap** : The dragon can slap one foe each round with its tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (this is an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).

**Crush (Ex)** : A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.

**Tail Sweep (Ex)** : This allows a Gargantuan or larger dragon to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).

**Breath Weapon (Su)** : Using a breath weapon is a standard action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds, even if it possesses more than one breath weapon. A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, whose areas vary with the dragon's size. If a breath weapon deals damage, those caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 the dragon's HD + the dragon's Con modifier. Saves against various breath weapons use the same DC; the type of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. A dragon can use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.

## Additional Dragon Rules

**Dragon Senses (Ex)** : Dragons have darkvision 120 feet and blindsense 60 feet. They see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

**Frightful Presence (Ex)** : A dragon's frightful presence has a range equal to 30 feet × the dragon's age category, but otherwise functions as detailed in the universal monster rules in the appendix.

**Spells** : A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description. Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type.

**Spell-Like Abilities** : A dragon's caster level for its spell-like abilities is equal to its total Hit Dice.

**Damage Reduction** : Dragons gain damage reduction as they age, as indicated in each dragon's specific entry. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Immunities (Ex)** : Every dragon is immune to sleep effects and paralysis effects. In addition, a dragon is immune to one or more additional forms of attack or energy damage no matter what its age, as given in its specific description.

**Spell Resistance (Ex)** : As dragons grow older, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the specific dragon descriptions. A dragon's SR is equal to 11 + its CR.

Special Abilities

**Change Shape (Su** An adult or older forest dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using _ [polymorph](spell_dir/polymorph#_polymorph)_.

**Destructive Crush (Su)** When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the debris field.

**Elemental Breath (Su** Once per day, when an ancient or older forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can [summon](monster_dir/universalMonsterRules#_summon a greater [earth](monster_dir/creatureTypes#_earth-subtype [elemental](monster_dir/creatureTypes#_elemental-subtype) within the cone. The caster level for these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.

**Sound Imitation (Ex** A very young or older forest dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful [Bluff](skill_dir/bluff#_bluff check against the listener's [Sense Motive](skill_dir/senseMotive#_sense-motive) check.

**Stony Death (Su)** Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a great wyrm forest dragon's breath weapon must also make a Fortitude save (same DC as the forest dragon's breath weapon or be petrified as the _ [flesh to stone](spell_dir/fleshToStone#_flesh-to-stone)_ spell. This is a death effect.

**Woodland Stride (Ex** As the druid ability of the same name.

Forest dragons, or dilung, are fickle and malevolent dragons that dwell in deep, rugged woodlands. While a forest dragon can fly, it prefers to stalk the earth, flying only to pursue objects of its wrath.

Infused with the power of waves and storms, sea dragons—or jiaolungs, as they are known in many lands—are draconic protectors of oceans and their creatures. Possessing tempestuous natures, sea dragons wander widely, sometimes claiming thousands of miles of ocean and coastlines as their protectorates.

**Dogmatic Discordance (Su** [Good](monster_dir/creatureTypes#_good-subtype or [evil](monster_dir/creatureTypes#_evil-subtype) creatures take a –2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura.

**Golden Armor (Su** Once per day as a standard action, an old or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy [resistance](monster_dir/universalMonsterRules#_resistance) 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action.

**Master Counterspelling (Su)** A great wyrm sovereign dragon can counterspell once per round as an immediate action. It need not know the spell it is countering, but can instead expend any spell that is one level higher to automatically counter the spell.

**Violent Retort (Ex** When a young or older sovereign dragon takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the creature that made the critical hit.
