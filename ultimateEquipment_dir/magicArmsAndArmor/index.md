# Magic Arms and Armor

Find a huge selection of magical special abilities that can be applied to armor and shields. Magically store your animal companion, familiar, or mount in hosteling armor, or protect against your most hated creature type with defiant armor. This section contains an extensive catalog of specific magical armor and shields. After these, it’s weapon time, again starting with special abilities. Why settle for a simple +1 longsword when you can have a heartseeker weapon capable of cutting through concealment? Last comes an assortment of specific magic weapons.
