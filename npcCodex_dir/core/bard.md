Court poets swirl from influential person to influential person in noble courts, attempting to gain favor through stirring verse and manipulative deeds. They can secretly direct realms with their words.

### Eksel Mertand

Eksel is the voice in the lord's ear. She attempts to lead the nation with her advice and influence, digging her claws into every aspect of court intrigue as deeply as she can. Her enemies become the enemies of the state, and those she despises risk execution or imprisonment. Eksel sometimes makes gloating visits to those she has imprisoned to remind them who is more powerful.

Discovered in a local tavern and favored by the previous king for her grandiose storytelling style and world-spanning collection of fables and anecdotes, Eksel began her life in politics. After that king's passing and the prince's ascension to the throne, Eksel remained at the new king's side. Close in age and sharing similar tastes for drinking and carousing, Eksel and the prince grew fond of each other. The bard is now firmly entrenched in the court and enjoys all of its prestige and financial splendor.

Many nobles enjoy Eksel's skills at oration, but secretly bear grudges against the lowborn woman. They are jealous of her relationship with the king, and complain among each other how her advice constantly trumps theirs. Any moves against Eksel draw great displeasure from the king, sometimes resulting in embarrassing punishments.

Eksel boasts a robust collection of jewelry and clothing. She constantly carries around a quill for taking notes on her enemies, and chews on it while she's plotting.

**Combat Encounters:** A careful schemer, Eksel is rarely encountered alone. She travels with a retinue of her lord's soldiers, supporting them in combat until discretion becomes the only avenue of survival. Then she attempts to flee or, if that's not an option, to negotiate the terms of her release.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Quick of wit and possessed of extreme cunning, Eksel might appear quiet and observant when first encountered. She sizes up her potential enemies and allies silently—and everyone is a potential enemy or ally—always looking for personal weaknesses to exploit or talents to manipulate in the service of her master.

Con artists are never what they first appear to be. They hustle the gullible using confidence schemes.

### Agail Enthess

Posing as a minor noble, "Lady Enthess" uses her assumed station in life to instill a sense of trust in her potential marks. Her apparent success and lavish lifestyle convince wealthy people of her success, leading them to invest in her various business ventures.

Lady Enthess sells counterfeits of relics supposedly discovered during a dangerous expedition. She keeps a few crates of these fakes in a hidden space in her basement. Through Enthess's adventuring business, investors fund her seemingly hazardous excursions. This tiered investment only ever pays out for Enthess herself.

Enthess also sells mining rights in the area. She purchases an old mine, supposedly played out decades ago, then sneaks in and seeds it with raw gems. She then hires a prospector to inspect the purchase. Once he returns with news of the great wealth, she sells the claim for much more than she originally paid.

Growing up on the streets, Enthess has defrauded hundreds of marks in her time. Though she enjoys bilking the clueless wealthy, she's not so noble as to leave the poor alone. It was among these people she was raised, and from them she learned some of the simplest frauds. One of her favorites when she was young was the glass drop: she would purposefully bump into someone on the street, drop a sack of already broken glass, claim the bag contained an expensive vase, and demand the mark pay for the damage. As she grew up and began adventuring, she expanded her swindles to a greater scale.

**Combat Encounters:** Unless supported by a group of bodyguards or shills, Agail stays out of combat—begging, cajoling, bribing, or bargaining when need be. If she is well supported, she provides aid (while invisible) before slipping away to continue her schemes and find a way to get revenge from a safe distance some other day.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** "Lady Enthess" is always on the lookout for new marks. Through polite and often delightful in conversation, she measures each person she meets, trying to find just the right con to fit the person in question.

### Meliski Traundor

Though he usually seems half drunk, Meliski's inebriation is only an act. This deception puts his opponents at ease, making them think he's an easy mark. They later discover he led them right into his trap when he takes all their gold by the end of the night. He knows all the tricks to spot when someone else is cheating.

Posted at a tavern table surrounded by a mug of beer, a stack of cards, and a worn bag of coin, Meliski outdrinks most other patrons. He plays cards all night, until the barkeep timidly begs him to leave so he can close up.

**Combat Encounters:** Never one to suffer cheaters lightly, Meliski doesn't back down from a fight when cards are involved.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Meliski is always found in a bar, gambling the night away. He welcomes new players, but brushes off anyone who doesn't ante up.

Street artists are active in urban politics, a little crazy, or both. Their art and messages delight some, but annoy landowners whose buildings become the artists' medium.

### Telkineel "Alleycat" Orbast

This elf creates masterpieces across the city, painting them on walls and across cobblestone streets. He signs his pieces by painting a cat's paw instead of a name. Some call these works graffiti, and they rarely stay up for long.

Telkineel is also a skilled dancer and acrobat, able to contort into mind-boggling positions. He learned dances from dozens of cultures over the years. In one amazing feat, he dances on a rope tied between two streetlights. This performance garnered him his nickname, and fetches the most coin from audiences.

**Combat Encounters:** Telkineel is often assailed by guards who don't appreciate where he puts his art. He flees as soon as he can, rarely stopping to thank anyone who comes to his aid.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Cheerful and whimsical, Telkineel can also be skittish. He tends to talk in riddles which, if deciphered, reveal truths about the city and its denizens.

Cruel instructors teach great knowledge, but in the most belittling manner.

### Ormal Ardem

Though bent and frail, Master Ardem intimidates his students and annoys other instructors. He's so entrenched in the university that everyone must pass through at least one of his classes. He never gives second chances, and nitpicks every assignment.

Ardem's skill at language and monologue, as well as his encyclopedic memory, allow him to dumbfound anyone of lesser intelligence and belittle those he considers beneath him. He sees himself a genius able to overcome any obstacle through reason.

Master Ardem doesn't believe anyone should have an easy time. He constantly uses obscure school bylaws to restrict other instructors in their spending and pursuits. He even got the school of divination removed from the curriculum, though he still uses the magic himself.

Though hard-hearted, Ardem shows tenderness to keyboard instruments. His skilled fingers dance across the keys of pianos and harpsichords, producing haunting and delicate pieces. For every person attending his concerts for his music, another has come to witness this cruel man be beautiful for a moment.

**Combat Encounters:** If forced into combat, Ardem calls students to aid him. He won't tolerate anyone but himself bullying or harassing students and fellow faculty, and comes to their aid with brash confidence.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Ormal belittles the slightest mistakes of speech or manners. If one can get past his condescension, he can be an excellent source of academic information thanks to his years of study and experience.

Mediums prey on those who have lost loved ones, or sentimental souls who wish to contact the great beyond.

### Halbert Nerik

Strange trinkets make this charlatan's house a museum of the macabre. During his seances, he uses both spells and mundane set-ups to make it appear as though spirits were present. Though he has no true power over spirits, Halbert plays the part of a supernatural conduit well.

Halbert chooses victims, researches them, and preys on their grief. Appearing as the lost loved one, he gains the trust of wealthy clients by repeating accurate information he researched. Once they trust him, he begins claiming the spirits want them to bestow lavish gifts upon him.

**Combat Encounters:** Some patrons respond violently when duped. Halbert retains sellswords to subdue them.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Halbert acts considerate, but cares only about separating suckers from their coin.

Chameleons are more comfortable portraying other people than appearing in their own natural forms.

### Arweena Melkoreth

Always shy and nervous about her bestial appearance when she was a child, Arweena experimented with hundreds of kinds of makeup and assorted treatments to change her appearance—with varying degrees of success. A bleaching attempt with dangerous chemicals left her scarred, and her eyebrows and body hair never grew back. Arweena began learning arcane arts, using illusions to mask her true appearance. Finding it easy to fool people, Arweena began taking others' identities. Now only a core of her old self exists, her mind filled with hundreds of personalities and illusory costumes. She constantly asks, "Who am I now?" Arweena became an actor, and found fame as a handful of starlet sensations. Few know these multiple celebrities are all one woman.

**Combat Encounters:** Arweena hires out her talent for minor cons and opportune larcenies in order to increase her wealth.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Arweena's talent for acting and need to become someone else make each interaction different. Even her few close friends have a hard time determining her true personality.

Courtesans specialize in music and other pleasures. They often serve as information brokers and spies.

### Siwar Kurash

Graceful, talented, and beautiful, Siwar provides the best companionship money can buy. Knowledgeable in topics ranging from art to politics, and highly schooled in etiquette, Siwar entertains lords and ladies every night, and her waiting list stretches months long.

Though seemingly compliant with clients, she compels other people through subtle influence, seeding her desires into clients and friends to ensure she is well fed, well clothed, and always entertained.

Though she has a reputation for maintaining clients' discretion, Siwar secretly trades information. Two criminal and political groups protect her and keep her indiscretions secret—and neither one realizes Siwar works for anyone else.

**Combat Encounters:** Not wishing to mar her beauty with wounds and scars, Siwar stays out of melee combat. Her charm and seemingly innocent nature can get her out of even the trickiest situations.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Siwar can be an informant in an urban area if PCs convince her to divulge what they need to know. She is attracted to influence, and tries to get close to the strongest fighter or most powerful wizard in a group of PCs. Siwar could instead find herself in conflict with PCs if they threaten her influence on local powers.

Tribal leaders use their abilities rather than brute strength to guide their tribes to victory.

### Esaye Polbele

Using magnetism and skill at deception, Esaye wrested control of her tribe from the previous chieftain, and now leads her brainwashed people to what she considers glory.

Sowing lies about the former leader, Esaye introduced dissent among the elders and strongest warriors, making sure her predictions came true while the chief's plans fell flat or resulted in ruin. After one too many bad omens and failures, the tribe dragged away the previous chieftain and sacrificed him.

Esaye now controls her people totally, and they lavish her with gifts and adoration. The tribe wages war against their neighbors, and those who refuse to assimilate into the growing clan face total destruction.Many abandoned villages, burned and reeking of rot, now dot the surrounding lands.

**Combat Encounters:** Esaye travels with a retinue of warriors, and supports them with her spellcasting. Those under her command lay down their lives for their chieftain.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** To keep in the good graces of the rest of the tribe, Esaye hires adventurers for missions the others find too distasteful or taboo.

Tunnel drummers keep time for acts of work and war carried out in deep warrens and mine tunnels.

### Takina Berzan

Takina's drum and bold voice echo through tunnels to frighten and demoralize opposing forces, and push his companions to fight with greater strength. As the battle rages, he wades into the fray with his mace named Rupture.

Takina strums his lyre of building to protect fortresses against magic or build new defenses for his clan.

**Combat Encounters:** Takina provides inspiration and healing to dwarven warbands and adventuring parties.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Takina is cheerful among dwarves, but stern to those he doesn't yet trust.

Spellswords make dangerous music with a mixture of swordplay and spellcasting.

### Palos Kendrosi

Trained exclusively at a prestigious elven academy, Palos learned a dual regimen of swordplay and magic. He trained for decades before venturing away from the alabaster spires and towering pines of his homeland.

To Palos, every adventure and every battle is a puzzle to solve with a combination of wit, might, and magic. Nearing his 200th year, he feels he is finally coming into his own.

**Combat Encounters:** Palos enters into a battle with the discipline and curiosity that befit a scholar, learning from each thrust, parry, and spell cast—and teaching a lesson to those who dare stand against him. He often surrounds himself with other adventurers; sometimes it's because he believes in their goals, and other times just for the chance to learn new tactics in battle.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Sometimes seeming aloof and distant, Palos is often on the lookout for new adventures and groups he can learn from. Other times, he might pursue a mission for a master or a cause.

### Milanet Rutteppi

Milanet's fun begins when another's ends. She ruins lives by spreading gossip and lies about rivals to damage their reputations. By being outwardly friendly, she keeps targets from knowing they're on her list until they hear these tall tales.

A celebrity, Milanet performs in plays and poetry events.

**Combat Encounters:** Milanet keeps foes off guard while her allies wreak devastation. When alone, she creates chaos and slips away so she'll live to fight again.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** In person, Milanet is always charming and entertaining, but keeps mentally sizing up those she interacts with for details and stories she can twist into nasty rumors.

### Rhortia Mooldon

Since she was a teenager, Rhortia has traveled with dozens of adventuring groups. She signs up with whoever promises the most excitement or the most lucrative reward. Rhortia spies on adventurers while they prepare in town so she can beat them to a good haul.

Rhortia learned throat singing while on a lengthy campaign, and uses that talent to augment her bardic performances and fill her opponents with unease.

**Combat Encounters:** Rhortia sits back and observes the flow of battle (while bolstering her allies), then enters the fray with a perfectly timed attack.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** She uses her hat of disguise to appear harmless, taking the guise of a fawning youth or inquisitive old person to gain information.

He weaves complex plots, while always leaving clues that point to someone other than himself. If one crime family knew Marlit (in one of his numerous aliases) was also working for a rival nation, they would hunt him down and behead him for treason.

**Combat Encounters:** Marlit assassinates undefended targets, and fights to survive when caught.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** With his athletic build and knowledge of strategy, Marlit masquerades as a military man.

Some doomsayers walk in solitude; others form cults to witness the end.

### Asha Garcer

After preaching the end times since her youth, Asha now seeks to hasten the apocalypse. Her cult, hundreds strong, sings the dirges of a dying world. Some say she exploits people's fears of the apocalypse, but others think Asha truly believes her rants. All of her cultists show total dedication. Though they would rather live to see the end of the world, they fight fearlessly to the death for Asha's cause.

**Combat Encounters:** A host of zealots defends Asha.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Any meeting to gain the grim cult leader's blessing requires an invitation.
