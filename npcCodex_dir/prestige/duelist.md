These brave warriors gain prestige within their tribes and clans by challenging and defeating enemy spellcasters.

### Yallathoon

The daughter of a warrior who was branded as a coward and a traitor by his tribe, Yallathoon had to work hard to prove her worth to her people. The shame of her father's misdeeds spurred her on, and she quickly moved up the ranks of the warrior caste. But it wasn't until she defeated a powerful wizard who tried to subjugate her tribe that Yallathoon's calling manifested. Branded with the title "Mageslayer," Yallathoon is hailed as the savior of her tribe, and the sins of her father have been long forgotten.

Though she despises arcane spellcasters and is leery of any divine casters who aren't obviously servants of her tribe's favored deities, Yallathoon isn't blinded by her role or her pride. If offered the chance to ally with a caster against a greater foe, she takes it—though nominally only to show up the caster with her martial prowess.

**Combat Encounters:** Yallathoon typically runs into the fray with other members of her tribe, but quickly breaks off from the pack to confront enemy spellcasters—in single combat, if at all possible.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Yallathoon is focused and proud, and is used to being treated with respect. She quickly dismisses those who do not treat her thus, but happily shares stories of her exploits with those who do. Warriors who disdain obvious magic items earn her approval, while anyone who notes the magic on her spear receives a flinty glare.

**Combat Gear** _potions of [cure serious wounds](../../spells_dir/cureSeriousWounds#_cure-serious-wounds)_ (2), _potion of [haste](../../spells_dir/haste#_haste)_; **Other Gear** _+2 mithral chain shirt_, _+1 rapier_, _amulet of natural armor +1_, _ [belt of physical might](../../magicItems_dir/wondrousItems#_belt-of-physical-might) +2_ (Str, Con), _ [cloak of resistance](../../magicItems_dir/wondrousItems#_cloak-of-resistance) +2_, _ [ring of protection](../../magicItems_dir/rings#_ring-of-protection) +1_, 180 gp

Anyone who questions the martial prowess of halflings should keep quiet around feisty hotspurs, as these diminutive bravos excel at poking holes in large people who underestimate them.

### Lylin Dalthainol

Growing up in a rough neighborhood, Lylin had to learn at a young age to fight fast and dirty. Her grace and feisty nature caught the attention of a traveling swordmaster and assassin, who took in the halfling as a student and raised her as a daughter. He cultivated her kill-or-be-killed nature, and trained her to be fearless and utterly ruthless in both battle and life. Her former master is long dead, but she has taken his lessons to heart, becoming a bold and competent killer. These days she's something of a loner, but still keeps an eye out for promising young halflings similar to herself as a child, so that she might pass on her advice and training. Though much of her knowledge is loudly proclaimed to be a "trade secret," she has often been known to boast of its central maxim: "Hit first, hit hard, and don't stop till you're painted red."

**Combat Encounters:** Lylin is proud, but also a selfish and opportunistic combatant who is quick to turn on allies when her own life is on the line. Though an assassin and mercenary by trade—one who might easily be hired by any villain and sent against the PCs—Lylin disdains anonymity, and would prefer to finish her kills in public (though she isn't averse to starting with a sneak attack from the shadows).

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Lylin's master taught her social graces, but even when diplomatic and pleasant, she is always sizing up potential opponents, and feels no qualms about taking life at the slightest provocation. She is far more likely to ally with a party that contains other halflings, though those who rely too much on racial camaraderie may be surprised by how quickly her backslapping friendship disappears if they dare question her methods.

Nimble for a dwarf, an iron duelist excels at hit-and-run tactics.

### Unthal Rumblegut

Born into a family of miners, Unthal learned at an early age that when wielded properly, the pick could become an effective weapon. When his clan's mines dug too deep into the Darklands, he was forced to defend his family mines against duergar and drow incursions, working with shielded defenders to lunge out from protective shield walls, using his mobility to take down dangerous foes before moving back behind the moveable walls of iron and dwarven muscle. His unorthodox tactics were mocked at first, with some seeing him as cowardly for not standing and fighting with feet planted like a normal dwarven warrior, but as the corpses of the clan's enemies mounted into piles, then great mounds, the whispers and jokes died. Now he enjoys high status within his clan, and teaches his ways to a new generation of dwarves, occasionally making pilgrimages out onto the surface to take his tactics to other holds.

**Combat Encounters:** Unthal's tactics work best when used in conjunction with more traditional dwarven defense strategies, and he often works in concert with other dwarven warriors. PCs intruding on dwarven territory—whether intentionally or not—may find themselves facing his pick.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Family and clan mean everything to Unthal. He is friendly to those who respect that, and hostile to those who do not.

Paragons of swordplay, these master duelists constantly search for foes to defeat in order to enhance their already formidable reputations.

### Dancer

No one knows Dancer's real name, and he has no intention of giving it. Some surmise from his foppish manners and arrogant attitude that he is the scion of some far-flung regent, but that guess is far from the mark.

Born in the slums, Dancer conned his way into aristocratic circles and learned swordplay from true masters of the art. He became a favored proxy for aristocrats not wanting to risk their lives when challenged to a duel, and killed innumerable nobles and their champions before growing full of himself and challenging one of the highest-ranking nobles personally. Rather than face him in the dueling circle, the noble sent a full legion of soldiers to kill the upstart, and Dancer barely escaped with his life.

Now, having discarded his given name, Dancer actively seeks out warriors with reputations for deft swordplay and finagles his way into challenging them. His sole purpose is to push himself to greater heights of prestige and skill.

**Combat Encounters:** Dancer always fights alone, trying to best powerful foes and groups to increase his reputation.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** In social situations, Dancer plays the part of the flippant dandy, luring opponents into a false sense of security.
