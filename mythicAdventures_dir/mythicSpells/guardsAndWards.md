Guards and Wards

**Source** [_guards and wards_](../../spells_dir/guardsAndWards#_guards-and-wards)

You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area as if by a mental _ [alarm](../../spells_dir/alarm#_alarm)_ spell as long as you're on the same plane as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the warded area as if using _ [arcane eye](../../spells_dir/arcaneEye#_arcane-eye)_. When you start concentrating, the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell (_ [dancing lights](../../spells_dir/dancingLights#_dancing-lights)_ and so on) instead of one.

**Augmented (3rd)** : You can place the following effects anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional use of mythic power per effect.

6. _ [Black tentacles](../../spells_dir/blackTentacles#_black-tentacles)_ in one place, returning after 10 minutes if dispelled.

7. _ [Dispel magic](../../spells_dir/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_ in one place. You select an area up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area is targeted by the spell. _Saving Throw_: Will negates. _Spell [Resistance](../../spells_dir/resistance#_resistance)_: yes.

8. _ [Entangle](../../spells_dir/entangle#_entangle)_ in four places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.

9. _ [Explosive runes](../../spells_dir/explosiveRunes#_explosive-runes)_ in three places, returning in 10 minutes if activated or dispelled.

10. _ [Slow](../../spells_dir/slow#_slow)_ in three places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.
