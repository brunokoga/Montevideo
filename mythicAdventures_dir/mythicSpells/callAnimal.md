Call Animal

**Source** [_call animal_](advance_dir/spells/callAnimal#_call-animal)

You can call up to one animal per 2 caster levels. Animals that answer your call have a starting attitude of friendly. Add your tier to [Handle Animal](skill_dir/handleAnimal#_handle-animal) checks attempted to influence these animals.

You may use this spell to call magical beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2, but they can attempt Will saving throws (with a +4 bonus) to resist the spell.
