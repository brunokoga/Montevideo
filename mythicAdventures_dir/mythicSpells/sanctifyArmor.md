Sanctify Armor

**Source** [_sanctify armor_](../../advanced_dir/spells_dir/sanctifyArmor#_sanctify-armor)

You gain DR 5_dir/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10_dir/evil.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.
