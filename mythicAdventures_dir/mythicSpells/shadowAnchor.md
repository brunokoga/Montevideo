Shadow Anchor

**Source** [_shadow anchor_](advancedRaceGuide_dir/uncommonRaces_dir/wayangs#_shadow-anchor)

Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast _ [shadow walk](spells_dir/shadowWalk#_shadow-walk)_ (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using _ [shadow walk](spells_dir/shadowWalk#_shadow-walk)_, this aspect of the spell has no effect).
