Endure Elements

**Source** [_endure elements_](spells_dir/endureElements#_endure-elements)

The target changes to one creature touched per level. Affected creatures gain cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5. They're not slowed by snow, and ignore penalties on [Perception](skills_dir/perception#_perception) checks and ranged weapon attacks from hail, rain, sleet, and snow. They treat wind as one category weaker.
