Boiling Blood

**Source** [_boiling blood_](ultimateMagic/spell_dir/boilingBlood#_boiling-blood

A target that fails its save takes 1d3 points of fire damage per round. If a target has the [orc](monster_dir/creatureTypes#_orc-subtype subtype, it also gains fire resistance 5.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can affect allies as though they had the orc subtype.
