Phantom Steed

**Source** [_phantom steed_](../spells_dir/phantomSteed#_phantom-steed)

The steed's rider automatically succeeds at [Ride](../skills_dir/ride#_ride) checks to remain mounted. The mount's hit points increase to 10 plus 2 per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster levels (maximum 150 feet).

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with it normally.
