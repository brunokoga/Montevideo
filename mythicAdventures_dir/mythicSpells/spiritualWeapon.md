Spiritual Weapon

**Source** [_spiritual weapon_](spell_dir/spiritualWeapon#_spiritual-weapon)

The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-flaming)_, _ [frost](magicItem_dir/weapons#_weapons-frost)_, _ [keen](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-keen)_, _ [merciful](magicItem_dir/weapons#_weapons-merciful)_, _ [shock](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-shock)_, or _ [thundering](magicItem_dir/weapons#_thundering)_. Before or after the weapon attempts all of its attacks for the round, you can redirect it to a different target as a swift action instead of a move action.
