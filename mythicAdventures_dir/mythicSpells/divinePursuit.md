Divine Pursuit

**Source** [_divine pursuit_](../ultimateMagic_dir/spells_dir/divinePursuit#_divine-pursuit)

The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increases by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. You gain a bonus on [Perception](../skills_dir/perception#_perception) and [Survival](../skills_dir/survival#_survival) skill checks attempted against the selected creature. This is a sacred bonus if you're good or a profane bonus if you're evil; if you're neutral, choose either the sacred or profane bonus.
