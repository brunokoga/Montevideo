Wall of Stone

**Source** [_wall of stone_](../spells_dir/wallOfStone#_wall-of-stone)

The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. The wall's hardness increases to 12.

**Augmented (7th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall is impassable to ethereal travel and spells such as _ [passwall](../spells_dir/passwall#_passwall)_ and _ [phase door](../spells_dir/phaseDoor#_phase-door)_. The wall is immune to non-mythic _ [disintegrate](../spells_dir/disintegrate#_disintegrate)_, _ [shatter](../spells_dir/shatter#_shatter)_, _ [sympathetic vibration](../spells_dir/sympatheticVibration#_sympathetic-vibration)_, and other non-mythic magical effects that specifically affect stone (including _ [earthquake](../spells_dir/earthquake#_earthquake)_, _ [soften earth and stone](../spells_dir/softenEarthAndStone#_soften-earth-and-stone)_, and _ [transmute rock to mud](../spells_dir/transmuteRockToMud#_transmute-rock-to-mud)_).
