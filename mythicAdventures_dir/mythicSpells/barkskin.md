Barkskin

**Source** [_barkskin_](spells_dir/barkskin#_barkskin)

The target also gains DR_dir/magic equal to the double the enhancement bonus the spell provides to the target's natural armor bonus.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell grants DR_dir/epic rather than DR_dir/magic.
