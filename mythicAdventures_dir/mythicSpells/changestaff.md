Changestaff

**Source** [_changestaff_](spells_dir/changestaff#_changestaff)

The treant-like creature created with this spell is considered a mythic creature, and it gains DR 10_dir/epic and slashing instead of gaining DR 10_dir/slashing.

**Augmented (7th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the creature gains the savage mythic template.
