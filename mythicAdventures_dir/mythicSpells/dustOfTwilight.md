Dust of Twilight

**Source** [_dust of twilight_](advanced/spell_dir/dustOfTwilight#_dust-of-twilight

A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the _ [sleep](spell_dir/sleep#_sleep)_ spell. Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the _ [lullaby](spell_dir/lullaby#_lullaby)_ spell.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells _mythic dust of twilight _dispels.
