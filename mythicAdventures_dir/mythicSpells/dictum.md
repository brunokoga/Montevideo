Dictum

When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nonlawful creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.
