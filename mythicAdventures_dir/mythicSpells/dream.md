Dream

You or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using _ [speak with dead](spell_dir/speakWithDead#_speak-with-dead_ to speak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resist this probing with a Will save (as _speak with dead_, using the DC _ [dream](spell_dir/dream#_dream)_ would have if it allowed a saving throw. Answers to these questions are still generally brief and cryptic.
