Prismatic Sphere

**Source** [_prismatic sphere_](../spells_dir/prismaticSphere#_prismatic-sphere)

When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a _ [prismatic spray](../spells_dir/prismaticSpray#_prismatic-spray)_ that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates directly away from you. The save DC of this _prismatic spray_ is the same as that of your _mythic prismatic sphere_.
