Special Abilities

**Detect Thoughts (Su** A rakshasa can _ [detect thoughts](spell_dir/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts)_ as the spell (CL 18th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent 3 rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Modify Memory (Sp** A mythic rakshasa can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to modify the memory of a creature whose mind it is reading, as the _ [modify memory](spell_dir/modifyMemory#_modify-memory)_ spell (CL 18th). The creature can resist with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Telepathic Dodge (Su** A mythic rakshasa gains an insight bonus to its AC against creatures whose minds it can read. It doesn't need to use its _ [detect thoughts](spell_dir/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts_ ability to gain this bonus. The rakshasa doesn't gain this bonus against creatures that are mindless or whose minds can't be read (such as from a _ [mind blank](spell_dir/mindBlank#_mind-blank)_ spell.

A mythic rakshasa is a natural mind reader and uses its abilities to tempt great heroes into failure and ruin—all toward to ultimate goal of seeding an entire civilization's destruction.
