A mythic lich is an undead spellcaster who gave up standard mythic path abilities in favor of abilities that preserve her existence and enhance her unnatural power.

# Creating a Mythic Lich

"Mythic lich" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with the lich template (referred to hereafter as the base lich. A mythic lich uses the base lich's stats and abilities except as noted here.

[**Mythic Subtype**](mythicAdventure_dir/mythicMonsters#_mythic-subtype): A mythic lich gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base lich. A mythic lich gains additional abilities depending on the base lich's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic lich gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).

**CR** : Adjust the base lich's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base lich's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic lich's abilities on Table 6–1 depend on the base lich's CR, not the final CR of the mythic lich.

**Tier** : A lich with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic lich loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic lich template, according to the base lich's CR.

**Channel Resistance (Su)** : A mythic lich's channel resistance increases to +8. At 8th tier, it increases to +12. At 10th rank, the lich becomes immune to channeled energy from non-mythic sources (except when used to heal undead).

**Creeping Paralysis (Su)** : A creature that strikes a mythic lich with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or non-reach manufactured weapon, or otherwise touches the lich must save or be affected by the lich's paralyzing touch ability. This triggers only once per round per creature.

**Mythic Phylactery (Su)** : A mythic lich's phylactery can't be harmed by non-mythic sources. At 8th rank, the phylactery becomes a minor artifact, and can be destroyed by only one specific method.

**Mythic Potency (Su)** : A mythic lich adds its rank to the save DCs for its fear aura and paralyzing touch abilities.

**Mythic Spells (Su)** : A mythic lich gains Mythic Spell Lore as a bonus feat. The lich has a pool of magical power it can draw upon for casting mythic spells. Up to twice per day, it can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power.

**Spell Resistance (Su)** : A mythic lich gains spell resistance equal to 11 + the base lich's CR (before adding the lich's mythic rank to its SR from the mythic subtype).

**Augmented Spellcasting (Su** : At 7th rank, a mythic lich selects one of the following archmage or hierophant abilities: [arcane surge](mythicAdventures/mythicHeroe_dir/archmage#_arcane-surge, [inspired spell](mythicAdventures/mythicHeroe_dir/hierophant#_inspired-spell, [recalled blessing](mythicAdventures/mythicHeroe_dir/hierophant#-recalled-blessing, or [wild arcana](mythicAdventures/mythicHeroe_dir/archmage#_wild-arcana). Once chosen, this selection can't be changed.

**Spell Perception (Su)** : At 7th rank, a mythic lich automatically notices spellcasting within 60 feet. The lich automatically pinpoints the location of the caster, identifies the spell being cast, and knows the intended target or area of the spell.

**Immediate Counterspell (Su)** : At 8th rank, a mythic lich can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to attempt to counter a spell. The lich must use a spell, spell slot, or dispel magic to counterspell as normal. This ability allows the lich to counterspell without first readying an action.

**Enhanced Spellcasting (Su** : At 9th rank, a mythic lich gains the ability to treat its 1st-level spells like cantrips or orisons. If the mythic lich is a spontaneous caster, its 1st-level spells known don't consume spell slots and can be used again. If the mythic lich prepares spells, its 1st-level spell slots aren't expended when cast and can be used again. Using metamagic feats or other abilities that alter the spell slot of a spell aren't affected by this ability (for example, a quickened _ [magic missile](spell_dir/magicMissile#_magic-missile)_ uses a 5th-level spell slot and is expended when cast).

**Sustained by Magic (Su)** At 9th rank, each time a mythic lich casts a spell it regains hit points equal to three times the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell.

**Formidable Animation (Su)** : At 10th rank, a mythic lich gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Any opponent attempting a dispel check against an effect on the lich rolls twice and uses the lower result. Anytime the lich attempts a dispel check, it rolls twice and uses the higher result.
