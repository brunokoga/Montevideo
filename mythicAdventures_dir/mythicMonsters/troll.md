Special Abilities

**Primal Vigor (Su)** If a mythic troll takes damage during a round, its regeneration increases by 5 at the start of its next turn, to a maximum of 25. If the troll is at full hit points at the start of its turn, its regeneration decreases by 5, to a minimum of 5. Damaging the troll with acid or [fire](../../monsters_dir/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) only partially suppresses its regeneration. On its turn following this damage, the troll regenerates only half the normal number of hit points (for example, a troll with regeneration 15 would heal 7 hit points) and can die normally on that round.

A mythic troll's skin is nearly as hard as stone, with bony growths, ornamental head spikes, and oversized teeth adding to its already grotesque visage.

## Ice Troll (CR 5_dir/MR 2)

A mythic [ice troll](../../additionalMonsters_dir/troll#_troll,-ice) gains bleed 5 (when it uses rend), feral savagery (rend), and primal vigor as its mythic abilities.

## Jotund Troll (CR 18_dir/MR 7)

A mythic [jotund troll](../../bestiary3_dir/troll#_troll,-jotund) gains bleed 5 (with bite), block attacks, feral savagery (full attack), fortification, ferocity, immunity to acid and cold, and primal vigor.

## Moss Troll (CR 4_dir/MR 1)

A mythic [moss troll](../../bestiary3_dir/troll#_troll,-moss) gains ferocity and primal vigor as its mythic abilities.

## Rock Troll (CR 7_dir/MR 3)

A mythic [rock troll](../../additionalMonsters_dir/troll#_troll,-rock) gains bleed 5 (with rend) and primal vigor. It can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to ignore sunlight petrification for 1 minute.

## Scrag (CR 6_dir/MR 2)

A mythic scrag's primal vigor activates even if it is out of water and would not otherwise be able to use its regeneration ability.
