**School** conjuration (summoning; **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one summoned creature

**Duration** 1 roun_dir/level (D

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell summons to your side a natural creature (typically an animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype, or a giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as you command.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material components (such as _ [wish](wish#_wish)_).

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10–2. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.

When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.
