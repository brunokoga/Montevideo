## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the adept NPC class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency** : Adepts are skilled with all simple weapons. Adepts are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.

**Spells** : An adept casts divine spells, which are drawn from the adept spell list. Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast _cure_ or _inflict_ spells.

To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) modifier.

Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each day during which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells.

Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 14–1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) score.

Where Table 14–1 indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) score for that spell level.

Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus) depending on the adept's magical tradition.

**Summon Familiar** : At 2nd level, an adept can call a [familiar](../classes_dir/wizard#_familiars), just as a wizard can using the arcane bond ability.
