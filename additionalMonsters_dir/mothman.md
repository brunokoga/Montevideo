Special Abilities

**Agent of Fate (Sp)** A mothman may recreate the effects of any spell of 5th level or lower once per day as a spell-like ability, but only if doing so steers the flow of fate in its proper course. What the proper flow of fate entails is determined by the GM. Typical uses of this ability include casting _ [major image](additionalMonsters/../spell_dir/majorImage#_major-image)_ to coax someone to a portentous location, casting _ [raise dead](additionalMonsters/../spell_dir/raiseDead#_raise-dead)_ to return someone with an important fate to life, or using _ [rusting grasp](additionalMonsters/../spell_dir/rustingGrasp#_rusting-grasp)_ to weaken a structure and cause some necessary calamity.

**Mind-Warping [Gaze](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_gaze) (Su)** [Fear](monster_dir/universalMonsterRules#_fear-(su-or-sp)), 30 feet, Will DC 18 negates. A creature that fails a save against this attack becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature currently suffering from a [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect that fails this save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting [fear](monster_dir/universalMonsterRules#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Little is known of these strange creatures, save that when they appear, calamity follows. Mothmen see themselves as agents of fate, exhibiting extraordinary powers to guide the hands of destiny. More often than not, citizens encounter a mothman and never recall the meeting, yet fall right into the creature's obscure plans.

Mothmen stand almost 7 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.
