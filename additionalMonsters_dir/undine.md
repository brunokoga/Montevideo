SPECIAL ABILITIES

**[Elemental](monsters_dir/creatureTypes#_elemental-subtype) Affinity (Ex)** Undine sorcerers with the [elemental](monsters_dir/creatureTypes#_elemental-subtype) (water) bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer class abilities. Undine clerics with the Water domain cast their Water domain powers and spells at +1 caster level.

Undines are humans whose ancestry includes elemental beings of water, such as marids. This connection with the Plane of Water is most noticeably manifested in their coloration, which tends to mimic that of lakes or oceans—all undines have limpid, blue eyes, and their skin and hair can range from pale blue-white to the   
deep blue or green of the sea.
