Special Abilities

**[Breath Weapon](monsters_dir/universalMonsterRules#_breath-weapon) (Su)** A jyoti's [breath weapon](monsters_dir/universalMonsterRules#_breath-weapon) is a focused burst of searing [fire](monsters_dir/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) infused with positive energy. [Undead](monsters_dir/creatureTypes#_undead) in the area take 11d8 damage rather than 11d6.

**Divine Aversion (Su)** Jyoti dislike deities and are never divine spellcasters. Jyoti gain a +2 racial bonus on saves against divine magical effects.

**Positive Energy (Su)** A jyoti's natural weapons and any weapons it wields strike as if they were _ [ghost touch](additionalMonsters_dir/../magicItems_dir/weapons#_weapons-ghost-touch)_ weapons. In addition, any weapon (natural or manufactured) a jyoti uses deals +1d6 [fire](monsters_dir/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) damage on a hit.

**Positive Energy Affinity (Ex)** A jyoti can exist comfortably on the Positive Energy Plane, and does not benefit (or suffer) from that plane's overwhelming infusions of life-giving energies. Whenever a jyoti is subjected to a magical healing effect, that effect functions at its full potential, as if enhanced by [Maximize Spell](additionalMonsters_dir/../feats#_maximize-spell).

Enigmatic and swift to anger, the avian race known as the jyoti are xenophobic natives of the Positive Energy Plane. Though some believe the jyoti are inherently good because their home plane is the source of all life, these beliefs are quite in error, for the jyoti react to all other races with wary suspicion at best, and usually assume the worst and attack before they can themselves be attacked. They guard their crystalline cities from all intrusion, especially by creatures from other planes and servants of the gods. They have been known to hold dangerous artifacts in their vaults on behalf of desperate visitors, though in the case of holy or unholy artifacts, the jyoti are more likely to destroy the artifacts as soon as possible.

Jyoti loathe natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane in particular, though there is an element of pity in their actions toward undead. They never discuss the sceaduinar, and even hearing that name inflames jyoti into immediate anger. Those who dare argue on the sceaduinar's behalf are immediately attacked.
