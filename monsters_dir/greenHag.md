**Special Abilities**

**Weakness (Su)** A green hag's claws sap strength from those she strikes. Each time a green hag hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 16 Fortitude save. Alternatively, a green hag can attempt to inflict even greater weakness on a foe by making a touch attack—this variant requires a standard action, and cannot be attempted in the same round the hag makes claw attacks. The opponent touched must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Mimicry (Ex)** A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near its lair.

Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbor an intense hatred for all beauty and purity. Making use of their varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly fond of using _ [disguise self](../spell_dir/disguiseSelf#_disguise-self)_ to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions—for the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast.

A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 160 pounds.

## Hag Covens

When three hags of any type gather, they can form a coven to gain increased magical ability. Any combination of hags can form a coven, but green hags are the most common members of such foul gatherings.

Whenever all three hags of a particular coven are within 10 feet of one another, all three of them can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: _ [animate dead](../spell_dir/animateDead#_animate-dead), [baleful polymorph](../spell_dir/balefulPolymorph#_baleful-polymorph) _(DC 18), _ [blight](../spell_dir/blight#_blight)_ (DC 17),_ [bestow curse](../spell_dir/bestowCurse#_bestow-curse) _(DC 17), _ [clairaudience/clairvoyance](../spell_dir/clairaudienceClairvoyance#_clairaudience-clairvoyance), [charm monster](../spell_dir/charmMonster#_charm-monster)_ (DC 17), _ [commune](../spell_dir/commune#_commune), [control weather](../spell_dir/controlWeather#_control-weather), [dream](../spell_dir/dream#_dream), [forcecage](../spell_dir/forcecage#_forcecage), [mind blank](../spell_dir/mindBlank#_mind-blank), [mirage arcana](../spell_dir/mirageArcana#_mirage-arcana) _(DC 18), _ [reincarnate](../spell_dir/reincarnate#_reincarnate), [speak with dead](../spell_dir/speakWithDead#_speak-with-dead), [veil](../spell_dir/veil#_veil)_ (DC 19), _ [vision](../spell_dir/vision#_vision)._

All three hags must take a full-round action to take part in this form of cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities function at CL 9th (or at the highest CL available to the most powerful hag in the coven). The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if with a Charisma score of 16 unless one of the hags has a higher Charisma score, in which case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that hag's Charisma modifier.

At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful hag covens might have additional spell-like abilities.
